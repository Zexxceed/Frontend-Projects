            <article class="intro1">My name's too long for some to memorize, so you can call me "Aries" instead. I am <strong>Arnold Ceigfred E. Seangoy II</strong>, a Bachelor of Science in Electronics Engineering graduate from Saint Mary's University. I am a licensed <em>Electronics Engineer</em> and <em>Electronics Technician</em> who is aspiring to be a frontend developer. I am currently taking on the Frontend Fundamental BootCamp and in the PHT10 batch. I had prior experience with coding using Java, Python, MATLAB, and HTML during my Senior High School and College classes. However, it was quickly forgotten due to my course's hectic and complex curriculum. OneCodeCamp is a surefire way for me to re-ignite my passion once more and improve my overall skills whether I change career and pursue programming in the future or increase my technical skills for a wide arsenal of knowledge.</article>

            <article class="intro2">Some quick facts about me is that I really like music. I listen to music extensively, maybe even the whole day for days and weeks straight. I play the guitar and did some few covers, and I also dance. I used to dance competitively during my Senior High School and College days, but I've been lazy recently. This song reminds me of my college days.</article>
