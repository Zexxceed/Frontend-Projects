            <p>Hello! A pleasant day to whoever is reading this. This small project/activity is to test my skills and knowledge so far on HTML and CSS. I made this simple website with the elements and attributes I've recently learned while also taking a few inspiration on some websites I've seen on the internet. For now, this is what I've concocted. It's not much, but I am quite stoked for the upcoming classes, to which I will see (hopefully) improvements to this website.</p>
            <p>Here's a good video to watch to get through my website:</p>
